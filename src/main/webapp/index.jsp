      The Yamuna originates from the Yamunotri Glacier, which is located in the lower Himalayas at an elevation of approximately 6,387 meters (20,955 feet). It is one of the main sources of the Yamuna River, along with the Tons River and the Saraswati River. The glacier is considered the birthplace of the Yamuna and is a popular pilgrimage site for devotees.

      From its origin, the Yamuna flows through the states of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, and Uttar Pradesh, before merging with the Ganges at Allahabad. Along its course, the river passes through numerous towns and cities, serving as a lifeline for millions of people who depend on its waters for irrigation, drinking, and other activities.
